I am MohammadHosein Gholamrezaei, currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Architecture at the University of Virginia under supervision of [Prof. Kevin Skadron](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~skadron/). I hold a Master's degree from the Department of Computer Engineering at Chosun University, Gwangju, South Korea. During my master's studies, I conducted research in Hardware Accelerators for Artificial Intelligence algorithms. My doctoral research at the University of Virginia is dedicated to Computer Architecture, with a specific focus on Hardware Accelerators and Processing In-Memory.
